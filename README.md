# VarangianRus
In this project, we extract information from some texts of the [TOROT Treebank](http://torottreebank.github.io/) and create exercises from it. The exercises are on different topics that are important to learn the morphology of Old Russian. We provided colorize, click, multiple choice (mc) and practice activities for all topics.

Navigate to [src/serverClientInteraction](https://github.com/eduard-schaf/VarangianRus/tree/master/src/serverClientInteraction) to read how to set up the server and use the user interface of this project.
